# Flaring star-planet interactions
## Orbital phase flare de-clustering in close-in star-planet systems

## Abstract

## Introduction

### Flaring star-planet interactions


If flares are triggered by the planet's orbital motion of the star

### Goal

Find clusters of flares in stacked and scaled light curves of transisting close-in Hot Jupiters

## Data

- Kepler light curves with transiting Hot Jupiters in close orbits around flaring stars
- A control sample would be Kepler light curves with transiting Hot Jupiters

### Assumptions about the data

1. The intrinsic flare production process is a Poisson process with a characteristic time scale that depends on the individual flaring activity of the star
2. Assuming 1. we can also assume periodic boundary conditions that allows us to search for clusters of flares during secondary eclipse.
3. The characteristic time scale for each light curve does not change in the period of observation.

## Methods

### Stacking and scaling

Stacking and scaling 

### Poisson process fitting

_relevant when dealing with real data_

### Thinning

### Emergent overdensity

# To-Dos:

- [] Implement thinning algorithm (J)
- [] Review thinning algorithm (J+K)
- [] Write description of the problem (K)
- [] Generate synthetic but realistic data sets to determine upper limits (K)
- [] Implement cluster detection in sets of thinned events (K)
- [] Describe mathematical foundations for Poisson process stacking and thinning
